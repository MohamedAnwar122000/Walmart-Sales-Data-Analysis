# Walmart Sales Data Analysis Project

## Project Purpose
This project aims to analyze Walmart's sales data to understand various factors that impact sales across different branches. By exploring this data, we identify top-performing branches, analyze product and customer trends, and uncover areas to enhance sales strategies. This analysis provides Walmart with insights for data-driven decision-making to improve overall sales and customer satisfaction.

## Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the [Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting). It contains sales transaction data from three Walmart branches located in Mandalay, Yangon, and Naypyitaw, and includes 1,000 rows and 17 columns. The dataset provides information on sales transactions, product lines, customer details, payment methods, ratings, and more, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of sales and customer behaviors across different regions.

## Analysis List
The project focuses on the following main analyses:

1. **Product Analysis**
   - Evaluate product lines to identify top-performing and underperforming products.

2. **Sales Analysis**
   - Analyze sales trends to measure the effectiveness of current sales strategies and explore opportunities for growth.

3. **Customer Analysis**
   - Investigate customer segments, purchasing behaviors, and profitability to gain insights into customer demographics and preferences.

## Approach Used
1. **Data Wrangling**: Initial inspection and cleaning to detect and handle NULL or missing values.
   
2. **Feature Engineering**: Generate new columns from existing data to create additional features for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: In-depth analysis to address project objectives and answer key business questions.
